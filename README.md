✨ Usability Heuristics
Here’s how Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics are applied in this app:

Heuristic	Application
1. Visibility of system status	The app shows feedback (e.g., active selections highlighted) to confirm actions like selecting a category.
2. Match between system and the real world	Uses intuitive icons (e.g., cart, film) to match categories users recognize.
3. User control and freedom	Users can freely select/deselect categories and change transaction type.
4. Consistency and standards	Common icons and buttons (e.g., back, save) follow mobile app conventions.
5. Error prevention	Simple, guided steps reduce errors—like selecting categories before saving.
6. Recognition rather than recall	Category icons and labels help users recognize options quickly.
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use	Quick add buttons and simple tap interactions speed up usage.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design	Clean, focused UI with minimal clutter to keep users engaged.
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors	Error states (like missing inputs) can be added for improvements later.
10. Help and documentation	Intuitive design means minimal documentation is needed, but can be extended with a Help section if desired.
